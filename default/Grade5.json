It was difficult because Mars is freezing cold and has very thin air. To keep the plants alive, they lived inside a giant glass dome. One morning, a red alarm flashed in Greenhouse 3. The heating system had broken! Aris grabbed his toolbox and sprinted through the airlock. He knew he had only twenty minutes to fix the heater before the frost destroyed the colony's first crop of tomatoes. With shaking hands, he reconnected the power wire just in time. That night, the whole crew celebrated by eating a fresh salad, the first meal ever grown on another planet.",
